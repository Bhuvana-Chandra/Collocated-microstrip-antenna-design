# Collocated-microstrip-antenna-design
- Designed a collocated microstrip antenna with specific parameters (substrate permittivity:4.6, via diameter:0.7mm)
- Achieved HFSS simulation results at 5.75GHz with S11: -19.2dB and cross-coupling parameters up to -48.58 dB
- Fabricated antenna showed a channel capacity of 12.25 bits/tx for MIMO, 3.75 bits/tx for SISO at 15dB SNR
